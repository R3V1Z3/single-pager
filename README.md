# Single-Pager
Single page website using Markdown. This project is just a single index.html file that pulls content from a `README` file and renders it using [Markdownit](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it). It's built for use with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How to use it?
It's super simple, just fork the repo and edit the `README` file as needed. Or copy the index.html file into an existing repo. As long as you have GitHub Pages enabled in the `Settings` tab, GitHub will ue index.html for front-end viewers.

## Features
Besides basic styling, code highlighting is supported using standard Markdown code symbols.
```javascript
for( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

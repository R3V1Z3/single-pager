# Single-Pager
Single page website using Markdown. This project is just a single index.html file that pulls content from this `README` and renders it. It's built for use with GitHub Pages.  

No HTML or JavaScript programming needed, just basic Markdown knowledge which is as simple as plain text. Simply edit the contents of this `README` file and changes will be reflected instantly when viewing through GitHub Pages.

## How's it work?
It's super simple, just copy the index.html file into your repository. As long as you have GitHub Pages enabled in the repo's Settings tab, GitHub will display index.html for front-end users.

### Capabilities
Basic styling including italics and other emphases are supported but code highlighting is covered as well.
```javascript
for( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
